# My Desktop Configs
This repository holds some configuration files I'm using on my xfce4 desktop.

The theme used is Adwaita-dark, and the icon theme is [Papirus icons + Breeze action icons](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1192944/). The clock format is set to `%-I:%M %p`, which simply appears as 12:34 PM.
